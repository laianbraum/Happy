## ðŸ’» Getting Started

<em>First of all, create a paste, because you'll need to clone two repositories (front-end and back-end)<em/>
<br/>
**Once you are in the paste, clone and run the front-end with**
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/laianbraum/Happy/.git
$ cd Happy
$ yarn start
```
That will run the app in the development mode.<br />

**Then you'll have to clone the [back-end](https://github.com/laianbraum/Happy-backend)**
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/laianbraum/Happy-backend.git
$ cd Happy-backend
$ yarn dev
```

Will run the back-end and everything will be all set.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in the browser.
